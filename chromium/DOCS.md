Source Documentation is found here: <https://github.com/jlesage/docker-baseimage-gui>

## How to use

Open the Web UI and browse, but be aware, this is mainly intended for testing and therefore does **not** keep its state.

## Automation via debug port

See <https://github.com/miaucl/ha-addons/tree/main/chromium-runner> for more details about the automation via the debug port, as it is based on the same functionality.
